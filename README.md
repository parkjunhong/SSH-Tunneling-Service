# SSH-Tunneling-Service
This service provides ssh tunneling sessions by using SSH remote port forwarding.\
Basically this allows you to add, delete and retrive a SSH tunneling session and remote port by using RESTful APIs.\
Also you are able to do above mentioned by using cli based on BASH script instead of RESTful APIs.
